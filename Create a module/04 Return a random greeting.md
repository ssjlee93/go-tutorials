## Go slice
> A slice is like an array, except that its size changes dynamically as you add and remove items. 
> The slice is one of Go's most useful (data) types.  

Dynamic array = Java ArrayList  

slice syntax 
```go
<var-name> := []<data-type>{
	// ... content
}
```
Seems like the spacing after data type matters.  
IDE corrects me not to have it.
